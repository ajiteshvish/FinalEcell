            An E-Cell (Entrepreneurship Cell) is a student-run organization that promotes innovation, creativity, and entrepreneurship among students. It acts as a platform to nurture ideas, provide guidance, and build an entrepreneurial mindset through events, workshops, competitions, and networking opportunities. The goal of an E-Cell is to inspire students to become job creators rather than job seekers by supporting startups, leadership, and skill development.
